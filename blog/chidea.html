              <p>Business leaders sitting on boards that meet infrequently have a need to collaborate in a way that is not demanding of their time or effort</p>

              <img alt="Chidea" src="./ChiDea Pitch Deck.003.png" class="image" width="100%">
              <p> Current communication protocols are too labor intensive, in noisy channels, or lacking transparency.</p>

              <p> With Chidea, when Eric Lefkofsky a board member of ChicagoNext is hit with a spark of genius for something to do with ChicagoNext, he is able to effortlessly share that with other members of ChicagoNext and has the option of sharing it with the public as well.</p>

              <p> Here, Eric is able to post about his new concept for ChicagoNext.  The format creates a place for ideas to be created that is cheap.  Cheap meaning, there is little social risk since there is not an expectation for a pixel perfect communication.</p>

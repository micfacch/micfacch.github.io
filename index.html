	<p>I draw my inspiration from three places: my principals, my passions, and an insatiable curiosity. I principally believe in leading an interesting life, creating meaningful relationships, making a difference, and never wasting a moment in the precious space of life. I am passionate about creating the world around me, beautiful things, experiencing life, and following my principals. Finally, I am not satisfied with not knowing about the world around me. I read a lot, I tinker more, and I question constantly.</p>
